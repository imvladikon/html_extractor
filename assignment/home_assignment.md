You are given a collection of 30K html files containing tables, +30K metadata files.
Those tables hold generated data. For each table (html file) there is a matching metadata (json file).
The metadata holds a dictionary format,
with 3 main sections: 
* header
* body
* footer.


We would like you to train a model that get an html file as an input and generate a corresponding
json file which holds the correct metadata.

Please try to present your thought process through code with Readme.md on a github repository.

You can use any library you would like, such as: Sklearn, PyTorch, Tesnorflow etcâ€™. 

The model
will be tested on our newly generated data.
In the next interview, we will go over and discuss the assignment.
For any question you have, feel free to approach either:
